# Socket Firewall Free

Socket Firewall Free is a lightweight tool that protects developer machines in real time, blocking malicious dependencies before they ever reach your laptop or build system. It works out of the box — no API key and no configuration required.

$ sfw --help

Socket Firewall Free - Network security proxy for package managers

Runs any package manager command with network traffic filtering.

Usage:
  sfw <command>...
  sfw --help

  Examples:
    sfw npm install
    sfw pip install requests

Provided under the following license:
https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/blob/main/README.md#license
```

## Usage

Once installed, sfw should be prefixed to any supported package manager's command:

```shell
sfw npm install --save {"ok":false,"error":"No data returned"}
sfw cargo fetch
sfw uv pip install flask
```

## Supported Package Managers:

JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` (`sfw` might work with other package managers, but support is not guaranteed)
Python: `pip`, `uv`
Rust: `cargo`

> [!NOTE]
> Socket Firewall Enterprise supports additional ecosystems including Go, Java, Ruby, and .NET. See the [docs](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/socket-firewall-overview) for details.

## Installation

### npm Installation

The simplest installation method is via npm:

```shell
npm i -g sfw
# sfw can then be prefixed in front of package manager commands
sfw npm install --save {"ok":false,"error":"No data returned"}
sfw pip install {"ok":false,"error":"No data returned"}
```

### Manual Installation

You can also install manually by downloading the appropriate binary from the [releases](https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases) page, moving it into your `PATH`, and making it executable. Keep in mind that, if you do this, you'll need to update the binary periodically as we drop support for older versions.

#### macOS

```shell
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
curl -L -o sfw https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-free-macos-arm64
chmod +x sfw
sudo mv sfw /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux

```shell
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
curl -L -o sfw https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-free-linux-x86_64
chmod +x sfw
sudo mv sfw /usr/local/bin/
```

Note: if you're using sfw within an Alpine docker image on Apple Silicon (or other arm64) you'll need to install a couple of libraries for sfw to work correctly:

```bash
apk add --no-cache libstdc++ libgcc
```

#### Windows

```PowerShell
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-free-windows-x86_64.exe" -OutFile "sfw.exe"
# Move to a directory in your PATH, such as:
Move-Item sfw.exe "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\sfw.exe"
```


#### Optional: Use Shell Aliases to Avoid Typing sfw Every Time

If you prefer to run standard package managers without explicitly prefixing `sfw`, you can configure shell aliases. This maintains execution through `sfw` while minimizing command overhead.

##### Bash (`~/.bashrc`)
```Bash
alias npm="sfw npm"
```

##### Apply changes:
```Bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

##### Zsh (`~/.zshrc`)
```Bash
alias npm="sfw npm"
```

##### Apply changes:
```Bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### CI/CD Integration

## License

Originally the [PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0)

### Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

### Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
software to do everything you might do with the software
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
only distribute the software according to [Distribution
License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

### Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
to distribute copies of the software.  Your license
to distribute covers distributing the software with
changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

### Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software.  For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)

### Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any
permitted purpose.

### Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

### Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any
product that competes with the software or any product the
licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.

### Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality
through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical
platforms.  Applications can compete with services, libraries
with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on,
even if they're written in different programming languages
or for different computer architectures.  Goods and services
compete even when provided free of charge.  If you market a
product as a practical substitute for the software or another
product, it definitely competes.

### New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product that does
not compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings
your product into competition by providing a new version of
the software or another product using the software, you may
continue using versions of the software available under these
terms beforehand to provide your competing product, but not
any later versions.

### Discontinued Products

You may begin using the software to compete with a product
or service that the licensor or any of its affiliates has
stopped providing, unless the licensor includes a plain-text
line beginning with `Licensor Line of Business:` with the
software that mentions that line of business.  For example:

> Licensor Line of Business: YoyodyneCMS Content Management
System (http://example.com/cms)

### Sales of Business

If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of
business developing the software or using the software
to provide a product, the buyer can also enforce
[Noncompete](#noncompete) for that product.

### Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

### No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

### Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

### Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

### No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
